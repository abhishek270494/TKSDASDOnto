# Tacit Knowledge Sharing Ontology (TKSDASDOnto)

## Overview

This ontology is designed to facilitate tacit knowledge sharing within distributed agile software development teams. It follows the NEON methodology and models key aspects of tacit knowledge transfer beyond traditional Scrum ceremonies.

## Structure

The ontology consists of three main subclasses under the TacitKnowledgeSharing class:

**Factors**: Influencing elements that affect tacit knowledge sharing.

**Dependencies**: Relationships between knowledge elements (to be refined later).

**ScrumProcess**: Processes in Agile Scrum that impact knowledge sharing.

## Features

Models how team members share tacit knowledge using tools like Confluence.

Captures tacit knowledge documentation related to Scrum artifacts.

Supports integration with semantic web technologies.

## Usage

***Clone the repository:***
